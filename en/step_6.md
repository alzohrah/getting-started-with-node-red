- Now go to the **Internet** menu and open **Chromium Web Browser**.

- In Chromium, locate the address bar at the top and type in `localhost:1880`, then press Enter. This will display the Node-RED interface. (Your Raspberry Pi does not need to be connected to the internet to use Node-RED: `localhost` is the address the Raspberry Pi uses to refer to itself and `:1880` means that it is looking at port 1880.)
