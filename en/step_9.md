## Deploying the flow

- Our flow is finished, so we can deploy it. Click on the big red **Deploy** button on the top right of the screen. A message should pop up at the top saying "Successfully deployed". This is similar to pressing the green flag in Scratch or F5 to run your code in Python.

- Now click on the blue square on the left of the **On** node to inject the message `1`. The **Green LED** node receives the message and your LED should light up. You should be able to turn the LED off by clicking the blue square on the **Off** node, which injects the message `0`.
