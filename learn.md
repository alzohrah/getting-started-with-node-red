By using Node-RED with your Raspberry Pi, you will learn:

- How to set up Node-RED flows
- How to control GPIO pins with Node-RED
- How to use Node-RED inputs, outputs and a switch (equivalent to a selection statement)
- Using Node-RED to simulate a NOT gate acting upon input from a button

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)
- [Use basic digital, analogue, and electromechanical components](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/creator)
